## Daily Planner

### Description

In this assignment, we learned to use third party api's. This allows us to simplify our query searching and use of attribute selectors. It helps cut down on the code we need to 
write without over cluttering or over complicating what we have written. 

JQuery and Moment.js were our choice of api's. Jqeury is good for selectors and moving through our html
while moment helps us with moment is used for time keeping and time setting.
